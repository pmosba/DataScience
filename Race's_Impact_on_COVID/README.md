Are minorities in America at a higher risk of contracting and/or dying from COVID-19? Are white people at a lower risk of contracting and/or dying from COVID-19?

Constantly in the news lately, we have been hearing about the pandemic. Many media outlets have expressed the fact that people who are Black or Hispanic are at a heightened risk of contracting it and even dying from the disease. I have also heard that those who are Native Americans are also at a higher risk. I was curious about what role race or being a minority had on the likelihood of getting sick from the disease. I was wondering also if poverty levels contributed to that at all, since typically minorities are more impoverished than white people. I was able to find data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. It shows data covering the time period from February 1, 2020 until October 7, 2020 and contains race data for: non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black, non-hispanic Asian, non-hispanic American Indian, Hispanic, and other.
