This project looks into the population decline of the Chinook Salmon in Puget Sound and the potential factors that are impacting it. Correlations between the population of the species and the potential factors are evaluated in order to predict how many salmon will be allowed to be harvested in future years. These predictions can help local fishermen, markets, and restaurants, that depend on the fresh, local fish, determine which species they should focus their efforts on. There was a lot of trial and error in searching for accurate and relevant data all from the Puget Sound area. Correlations and relationships between the variables (salmon species abundance, temperatures, sea lion abundance, Seattle population, and harvest amounts for both recreational and commercial fishing) have been studied and evaluated. The results were deployed so that users can input a value for a future Seattle Population or California Sea Lion Population in order to receive a predicted amount of fish that will be allowed to be harvested in the future. The goal is to give local fishermen, markets, and restaurants a better idea of how the Chinook Salmon harvest amounts could change in the future based on these two variables.
